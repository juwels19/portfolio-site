      "I’ve built scalable, resilient data pipelines designed for reliability under heavy workloads. To safeguard critical data, I implemented a dynamic checkpoint system that allows seamless saving and recovery throughout the pipeline. I also integrated cloud services to horizontally scale processing capabilities, enabling efficient concurrent usage and boosting overall system performance.",

      "I focussed on optimizing data workflows and transforming raw information into actionable insights for the bank's entire GIC portfolio. By overhauling legacy systems with fast, scalable data structures, I reduced the runtime of a critical data pipeline by 500% (yes - that is not a typo). I also designed a customer segmentation program that resolved a persistent error in a deployed pipeline, cutting manual intervention by 97%. To improve team-wide reporting, I automated a PowerBI dashboard to seamlessly parse and visualize multiple data streams. Across all projects, I work closely with stakeholders to deliver insights and visualizations that drive high-impact business decisions.",

      "In this role I built advanced tools to push the boundaries of hockey analytics. I developed a multi-branch Convolutional Deep Learning Network in PyTorch to calculate the “Expected Possession Value” of hockey passes, training the model on over 140,000 tensors and 13 layers of spatiotemporal features extracted from broadcast footage. I also built an Optical Character Recognition model that achieves 85% accuracy in detecting game context—like period, time remaining, and clock location—directly from video frames. To optimize performance, I implemented a centralized datastore that reduced load times by 150% for end-users. On the client side, I designed and deployed three interactive Shiny web applications powered by machine learning models, delivering real-time, data-driven insights to over 200 users.",

      "I developed an automated VBA tool that integrates with legacy systems, saving over 15 engineering hours annually by extracting KPIs from thousands of client documents. To modernize internal processes, I designed and built a full-stack, RESTful web application using Python and Django to enhance client deliverable tracking. Additionally, I optimized financial operations by improving a Python-based invoicing service that queries the CRA website, resulting in a 50% acceleration in client payments. My work is always backed by comprehensive technical documentation that supports maintainability, troubleshooting, and highlights opportunities for future enhancements.",
