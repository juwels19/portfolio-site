    description:
      "This was my first time teaching others to build a scalable, reliable web app. I worked with five high school students with no prior experience to create a data collection tool for FIRST robotics matches, used by 40 people across five teams. The frontend uses Next.js with the app router, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui, while the backend runs on a PostgreSQL database on Supabase with Prisma. Authentication is handled with Clerk, and the app includes a webhook to save user data. It was a great experience guiding others through building a real-world project.",

The frontend is built with Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui, while the backend uses MongoDB with Prisma. I integrated the Google Maps API for embedded maps and address autocomplete, and used Uploadthing to upload images of visited restaurants. Itâ€™s been a fun way to organize my culinary adventures.",
